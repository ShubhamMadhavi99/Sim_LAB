Problem Statement:

Consider 3-ray model (1 direct path and 1 multipath reflecting from ground, 1 multipath reflecting from ionosphere ) where transmitter and receiver are placed 4000m apart at BTS tower of height 500m. Transmitter and receiver are equipped with Omni directional antennas radiating FM signal of 0.1 micro second with frequency varying from 824 MHz to 834 MHz. Consider specular reflection happens at dry ground surface of earth ionosphere. Derive mathematical expression for received signal at receiver antenna and study effects of multipath over estimated received signal. Use Nyquist theorem for deciding sampling rate. Refer suitable assumptions to solve above problem.

# Assignment_3

Problem Statement :

Consider 2-ray model (1 direct path and 1 multipath reflecting from ground) where transmitter and receiver are placed 4000m apart at BTS tower of height 121m. Transmitter and receiver are equipped with Omni directional antennas radiating FMCW signal of 0.1 second window of frequency varying from 824MHz to 834MHz. Consider specular reflection happens at dry ground surface of earth. Derive mathematical expression for received power at receiver antenna and study effects of multipath fading over estimated power of received signal. Use Nyquist theorem for deciding sampling rate. Refer suitable assumptions to solve above problem.
